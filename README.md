# Waffles Firmware 🐶🐶🐶

Ethical hacking & defensive cybersecurity firmware for embedded devices
Lightweight, audit-friendly firmware and tooling designed for responsible security research, lab-based pentesting, and device hardening practice. Built with transparency, testability, and strong ethical safeguards at the core.

### Key features 🐶

Minimal, auditable firmware stack for common microcontrollers (template-based, hardware-agnostic).

Secure boot & basic runtime integrity checks (reference implementations).

Safe, sandboxed diagnostic tools for network/USB/serial observation in lab environments.

Logging & forensics hooks to capture reproducible test artifacts.

CI-friendly build matrix and firmware signing examples.

Developer-focused: comprehensive docs, unit tests, and example lab topologies.

Strong emphasis on legality, consent and responsible disclosure — for research/use in controlled environments only.

### Who it's for 🐶

Security researchers building reproducible embedded-device tests.

Red-team/blue-team labs that need a safe, auditable firmware baseline.

Educators teaching secure embedded development and ethical hacking.

Device teams who want a reference for hardening their own firmware.


⚠️ Important: Waffles Firmware is for ethical research, education, and defensive testing in controlled environments only. Do not deploy to devices connected to production networks or devices you do not own/explicitly have permission to test.
